# Playlist System - Complete Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the fully implemented playlist system with Play and Remix modes, including all bug fixes, enhancements, and token optimizations.

## ‚úÖ Requirements Implemented

### 1. **Bug Fixes**

#### ‚úÖ Fixed 500 Internal Server Error
- **File**: `app/api/playlists/add-saved-lessons/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added validation to ensure lessons exist in `saved_lessons` before adding
  - Better error handling with specific HTTP status codes (404, 409, 400)
  - Prevents adding invalid lesson references
  - Validates lesson IDs against saved_lessons table

#### ‚úÖ Fixed "All Lessons" Search
- **File**: `app/playlists/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Now searches `lesson_history` table instead of non-existent `lessons` table
  - Parses `lesson_data` JSONB field to extract lesson information
  - Filters by title and subject from lesson history
  - Auto-saves lessons to `saved_lessons` when adding from "All Lessons"

### 2. **New Features**

#### ‚úÖ Play & Remix Buttons
- **Location**: `app/playlists/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 977-1032)
- **Features**:
  - **Play Playlist**: Emerald gradient button with animated sparkle icon
  - **Remix Playlist**: Purple gradient button with rotating sparkle icon
  - Spring physics animations on hover and tap
  - Shimmer effect on hover
  - Color-coded shadows (emerald for Play, purple for Remix)
  - Only visible when playlist has lessons

#### ‚úÖ Playlist Learning Feed (FYP-Style)
- **File**: `app/playlists/[id]/learn/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - FYP-style swipe interface
  - Drag gestures (swipe up/down to navigate)
  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, spacebar, PageUp/Down)
  - Auto-advance after quiz completion
  - Progress bar with smooth animations
  - Mode badge (Play or Remix)
  - Quiz locking (must complete quiz to advance)
  - Floating background gradients
  - Responsive design (mobile-first)

#### ‚úÖ Remix Playlist API (Token-Optimized)
- **File**: `app/api/playlists/[id]/remix/route.ts`
- **Token Optimization Strategy**:

  **Smart Concept Extraction**:
  - Multi-factor scoring algorithm
  - Scores sentences based on:
    - Academic keywords (theorem, formula, law, etc.) - 3x weight
    - Explanatory phrases (this means, for example) - 2x weight
    - Mathematical/numeric content - 2x weight
    - Title overlap - 2x weight
    - Position bonus (early sentences) - 1x weight
    - Length sweet spot (8-20 words) - 1x weight
    - Capitalized terms (proper nouns) - 1x per term
  - Removes filler words (very, really, actually, etc.)
  - Compacts whitespace
  - Truncates intelligently at word boundaries

  **Compression Results**:
  - Original: 500-1000 words per lesson (~2000-4000 chars)
  - Compressed: 3 concepts √ó 120 chars = ~360 chars per lesson
  - **Token Reduction: ~85-90%**

  **Pattern Analysis**:
  - Extracts subjects, topics, difficulty levels
  - Identifies common concept themes
  - Finds question types (multiple-choice, conceptual, problem-solving)

  **AI Generation**:
  - Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  - Temperature 0.8 for creative variations
  - Generates 1-20 fresh lessons (default 10)
  - Returns full lessons with content and quizzes

  UNIQUE(playlist_id, profile_id)
);
```

#### **playlist_items**

### RLS Policies

All tables have Row Level Security enabled:

- **Users can only access their own data** (playlists, saved lessons, history)
- **Public playlists** are viewable by all authenticated users
- **Shared playlists** are viewable by members (viewer/moderator)
- **Moderators** can add/remove lessons from shared playlists
- **Owners** have full control over their playlists

See `database/playlist-schema-and-policies.sql` for complete RLS policies.

- **85-90% reduction in input tokens**
- Faster response times
- Lower API costs

### Smart Concept Extraction

The algorithm intelligently selects the most important sentences:
