# üìö Study Sessions Database Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the `study_sessions` table in your Supabase database.

## üéØ What You're Setting Up

The study sessions feature allows users to:
- Plan study sessions with their friends
- Schedule sessions with date, time, and duration
- Add subjects, topics, and notes
- View upcoming study sessions
- Update session status (pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Access to your Supabase project dashboard
- Admin access to the SQL Editor
- The `profiles` and `friendships` tables must already exist

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"+ New query"**

### Step 2: Run the SQL Script

1. Open the file `supabase-study-sessions-setup.sql` in this directory
2. Copy **ALL** the contents
3. Paste into the SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** (or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`)

### Step 3: Verify Setup

After running the script, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Study sessions table created successfully!
‚úÖ Indexes created for optimal performance
‚úÖ RLS policies configured
‚úÖ Triggers set up for updated_at

You can now use the study planner feature!
```

You should also see a verification table showing:
- 4 RLS policies created
- 6 indexes created

## üîç What Gets Created

### 1. **Main Table: `study_sessions`**
```sql
Columns:
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- organizer_id (UUID, Foreign Key ‚Üí profiles.id)
- friend_id (UUID, Foreign Key ‚Üí profiles.id)
- title (TEXT, Required, Max 200 chars)
- description (TEXT, Optional, Max 1000 chars)
- subject (TEXT, Optional)
- topics (TEXT[], Array)
- scheduled_at (TIMESTAMPTZ, Required)
- duration_minutes (INTEGER, Default 60, Max 480)
- status (TEXT, Default 'pending')
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ, Auto)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ, Auto)
```

### 2. **Indexes** (6 total for optimal performance)
- `idx_study_sessions_organizer_id` - Fast organizer lookups
- `idx_study_sessions_friend_id` - Fast friend lookups
- `idx_study_sessions_scheduled_at` - Fast date queries
- `idx_study_sessions_status` - Fast status filtering
- `idx_study_sessions_user_scheduled` - Composite index for common queries
- `idx_study_sessions_friend_scheduled` - Composite index for friend queries

### 3. **RLS Policies** (4 total for security)

#### Policy 1: SELECT
**"Users can view their own study sessions"**
- Users can view sessions where they are organizer OR friend
- Prevents viewing other people's sessions

#### Policy 2: INSERT
**"Users can create study sessions with friends"**
- Users can only create sessions where they are the organizer
- Friend must exist in the friendships table
- Prevents creating sessions with non-friends

#### Policy 3: UPDATE
**"Users can update their own study sessions"**
- Users can update sessions where they are organizer OR friend
- Both parties can update session details

#### Policy 4: DELETE
**"Users can delete their own study sessions"**
- Only the organizer can delete a session
- Friend cannot delete (they can cancel status instead)

### 4. **Triggers**
- `trigger_update_study_sessions_updated_at` - Auto-updates `updated_at` timestamp

### 5. **Constraints**
- `different_users` - Organizer and friend must be different users
- `future_scheduled_at` - Sessions must be scheduled in the future
- `status` check - Status must be: pending, confirmed, cancelled, or completed
- `duration_minutes` check - Duration between 1 and 480 minutes (8 hours)

## üß™ Testing the Setup

### Test 1: Verify Table Exists
```sql
SELECT * FROM study_sessions LIMIT 1;
```
Expected: Empty result set (no error)

### Test 2: Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'study_sessions';
```
Expected: 4 policies listed

### Test 3: Verify Indexes
```sql
SELECT indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'study_sessions';
```
Expected: 6 indexes listed

### Test 4: Insert Test Data (Optional)
```sql
-- Replace with actual user IDs from your profiles table
INSERT INTO study_sessions (
    organizer_id,
    friend_id,
    title,
    subject,
    topics,
    scheduled_at,
    duration_minutes
) VALUES (
    'YOUR_USER_ID'::UUID,
    'FRIEND_USER_ID'::UUID,
    'Test Study Session',
    'Mathematics',
    ARRAY['Algebra', 'Geometry'],
    NOW() + INTERVAL '1 day',
    60
);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation profiles does not exist"
**Solution**: You need to create the `profiles` table first. The study_sessions table references it.

### Error: "relation friendships does not exist"
**Solution**: You need to create the `friendships` table first. The RLS policies check against it.

### Error: "permission denied for table study_sessions"
**Solution**: Make sure RLS is enabled and policies are created. Re-run the SQL script.

### Error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
**Solution**: The session already exists. Use a different ID or delete the existing session first.

### Sessions not showing up in the app
**Checklist**:
1. ‚úÖ Table created successfully
2. ‚úÖ RLS enabled and policies created
3. ‚úÖ User is authenticated
4. ‚úÖ Friendship exists between users
5. ‚úÖ Session scheduled in the future
6. ‚úÖ Session status is 'pending' or 'confirmed'

## üîß Maintenance

### View All Sessions
```sql
SELECT
    s.*,
    o.full_name as organizer_name,
    f.full_name as friend_name
FROM study_sessions s
LEFT JOIN profiles o ON o.id = s.organizer_id
LEFT JOIN profiles f ON f.id = s.friend_id
ORDER BY s.scheduled_at DESC;
```

### View Upcoming Sessions for a User
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_upcoming_sessions('USER_ID_HERE'::UUID, 10);
```

### Clean Up Past Sessions
```sql
-- Mark past pending sessions as cancelled
UPDATE study_sessions
SET status = 'cancelled'
WHERE scheduled_at < NOW()
  AND status = 'pending';
```

### Delete All Test Data
```sql
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This deletes ALL study sessions!
DELETE FROM study_sessions;
```

## üìä Database Statistics

### Check Table Size
```sql
SELECT
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('study_sessions')) as total_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('study_sessions')) as table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('study_sessions') - pg_relation_size('study_sessions')) as indexes_size;
```

### Count Sessions by Status
```sql
SELECT
    status,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM study_sessions
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## üéâ You're All Set!

Once the SQL script runs successfully, you can:

1. Navigate to the Friends page: `http://localhost:3000/friends`
2. Click "Plan session" on any friend
3. Fill out the beautiful multi-step form
4. Create your first study session!

The study sessions will appear in the "Upcoming study sessions" section on the friends page.
