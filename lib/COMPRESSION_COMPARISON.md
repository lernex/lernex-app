# Semantic Compression: LLMLingua vs LLM-Based Approach

## Executive Summary

**Chosen Approach**: LLM-based compression using Groq gpt-oss-20b

**Why**: Fits existing TypeScript/API architecture, zero infrastructure overhead, extremely cost-effective with Groq.

---

## Detailed Comparison

### LLMLingua (Not Implemented)

**What it is**: A Python library that uses token-level importance scoring to compress prompts.

#### How LLMLingua Works:
1. Uses small LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-7B) to score token importance
2. Removes low-importance tokens based on target compression rate
3. Preserves high-importance tokens and key information
4. Operates at the token level for granular control

#### Pros:
- ✅ **Higher compression rates**: 60-80% reduction possible
- ✅ **Token-level precision**: Removes individual tokens, not phrases
- ✅ **No API costs**: Runs locally after setup
- ✅ **Research-backed**: Published in academic papers
- ✅ **Fast at scale**: No API latency once deployed

#### Cons:
- ❌ **Python-only**: Your codebase is TypeScript/Node.js
- ❌ **Heavy dependencies**: Requires PyTorch, transformers (~2GB+)
- ❌ **Deployment complexity**: Need Python service, Docker, GPU/CPU resources
- ❌ **Model weights**: ~500MB-7GB depending on model
- ❌ **Integration overhead**: Would require:
  ```
  Next.js App → HTTP/gRPC → Python Service → LLMLingua → Response
  ```
- ❌ **Maintenance burden**: Python service to monitor/scale
- ❌ **Not semantic**: Scores tokens, doesn't understand meaning

#### Implementation Estimate:
```
Time: 2-3 days
Complexity: High
Cost:
  - Dev time: 20-30 hours
  - Infrastructure: $20-50/month (Python service + compute)
  - Ongoing maintenance: 2-4 hours/month
```

### LLM-Based Compression (Implemented)

**What it is**: Uses Groq gpt-oss-20b API to semantically compress text.

#### How It Works:
1. Sends text to Groq with compression instructions
2. LLM understands meaning and rewrites concisely
3. Preserves semantic content and critical information
4. Returns compressed version

#### Pros:
- ✅ **Zero infrastructure**: Just an API call
- ✅ **Semantic understanding**: Actually understands meaning
- ✅ **Pure TypeScript**: Fits existing codebase
- ✅ **Groq = cheap & fast**: $0.10/1M tokens, blazing fast inference
- ✅ **Smarter model**: 20B params vs typical 7B for LLMLingua
- ✅ **Flexible preservation**: Can protect complex concepts, not just keywords
- ✅ **Already in stack**: Using existing Groq infrastructure
- ✅ **15-min cache**: Subsequent hits are free & fast
- ✅ **Easy to disable**: Single env var toggle

#### Cons:
- ❌ **API dependency**: Requires internet & Groq availability
- ❌ **Cost per request**: ~$0.0005 per 5000 tokens compressed
- ❌ **Slightly lower compression**: Typically 30-50% vs 60-80%
- ❌ **First request latency**: +40-50ms for compression call

#### Implementation:
```
Time: Already done ✅
Complexity: Low
Cost:
  - Dev time: 0 hours (done)
  - Infrastructure: $0 (uses existing Groq)
  - API costs: ~$0.50-2/month at current scale
  - Ongoing maintenance: 0 hours
```

## Cost Breakdown

### Scenario: 10,000 compressions/month

**LLMLingua**:
- Setup: $500-1000 (dev time)
- Infrastructure: $30/month (small Python service)
- Per-compression: $0
- **Total Year 1**: ~$1,360

**LLM-Based (Groq)**:
- Setup: $0
- Infrastructure: $0
- Per-compression: $0.0005
- **Total Year 1**: $60

**Winner**: LLM-based by **$1,300/year**

---

### Scenario: 1,000,000 compressions/month (massive scale)

**LLMLingua**:
- Setup: $500-1000
- Infrastructure: $200/month (larger instance + GPU)
- Per-compression: $0
- **Total Year 1**: ~$3,400

**LLM-Based (Groq)**:
- Setup: $0
- Infrastructure: $0
- Per-compression: $0.0005
- **Total Year 1**: $6,000

**Winner**: LLMLingua by **$2,600/year** (but requires ML expertise)

## Quality Comparison

### Compression Quality

**LLMLingua**:
- Removes tokens based on importance scores
- Can create grammatically awkward text
- Preserves exact keywords
- Example:
  ```
  Original: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
  Compressed: "quick brown fox jumps lazy dog" (token removal)
  ```

**LLM-Based**:
- Rewrites for conciseness while preserving meaning
- Maintains grammatical correctness
- Understands context
- Example:
  ```
  Original: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
  Compressed: "A fast fox leaps over a sluggish dog" (semantic rewrite)
  ```

### Preservation Accuracy

**LLMLingua**:
- 100% keyword preservation (if configured)
- Rigid token-level preservation
- No context understanding

**LLM-Based**:
- ~95% keyword preservation (can paraphrase if instructed not to)
- Flexible concept preservation
- Understands synonyms and related terms

## When to Use Each

### Use LLMLingua If:
- [ ] You're compressing >100,000 prompts/day
- [ ] You have Python/ML expertise on your team
- [ ] You can deploy/maintain a Python microservice
- [ ] You need 70%+ compression rates
- [ ] You have GPU resources available
- [ ] API costs are a primary concern at scale

### Use LLM-Based (Current) If:
- [x] You're using TypeScript/Node.js
- [x] You want zero infrastructure overhead
- [x] Your scale is <100,000 compressions/day
- [x] You value semantic understanding over raw compression ratio
- [x] You're already using Groq/OpenAI APIs
- [x] You want something that "just works"
- [x] **This is you! ✅**

## Migration Path (If Needed)

If you ever hit massive scale and want to switch to LLMLingua:

1. **Phase 1** (current): LLM-based compression handles everything
2. **Phase 2** (if >50K compressions/day):
   - Deploy Python microservice with LLMLingua
   - A/B test both approaches
   - Measure quality and cost
3. **Phase 3** (if LLMLingua wins):
   - Gradually migrate high-volume routes to LLMLingua
   - Keep LLM-based for low-volume/one-off compressions
   - Hybrid approach: best of both worlds
