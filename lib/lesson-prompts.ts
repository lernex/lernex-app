    `Set subject to the Subject line, topic to structured_context.summary.focus, and difficulty to the requested difficulty.`,
    `content must be exactly four sentences: (1) definition sentence, (2) example with concrete numbers/setup, (3) common pitfall to avoid, (4) next step for practice. Target 90-100 words total and keep under 900 characters.`,

    `- Verify the content is factually accurate with no contradictions`,
    `- Ensure the lesson is coherent, educational, and appropriate for the target difficulty`,
    `- Confirm all structural requirements are met (word counts, question format)`,
    `- If anything seems wrong, fix it before responding - there is no second review`,
